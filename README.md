### NeuralUQ: A comprehensive library for UQ in neural differential equations and operators
##### (Zongren Zou, Xuhui Meng, Apostolos F Psaros, George Em Karniadakis: [Github repository](https://github.com/Crunch-UQ4MI/neuraluq.git))
Welcome in our GitHub repository, where there is all the work we did to study the NeuralUQ library. 

In the examples repository you can find both the examples proposed by the original authors and our study cases.
    
Users can refer to this paper for the design and description, as well as the examples, of the NeuralUQ library:
- [NeuralUQ: A comprehensive library for uncertainty quantification in neural differential equations and operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11866)

### Installation
**NeuralUQ** requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Tensorflow 2.9.1
- TensorFlow Probability 0.17.0

Then install with `python`:

```
$ python setup.py install
```
